# Telegram Installation

Consuming the Susi API with Telegram is fairly straightforward in telegram. The use of `botfather` in telegram ensures that the bots can be created with ease. So the first step is to login into telegram with your user account and search and talk to `BotFather`. Bot father would ask a few questions and then provide the required token. You need to save this token and the bot powered by susi is now available.

Once this is set, you need to update the token using heroku as follows

`heroku config:set TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=AVERYLONGTOKEN:GOESOVERHEREFORYOUTORUNSUSIONTELEGRAM`
