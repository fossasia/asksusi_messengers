AskSusi is a messenger bot that answers your question by using big data from loklak and a number of API services. In this repository we keep AskSusi chatbots for social media platforms. We have integrated AskSusi on Facebook Messenger, Slack and Telegram. All of the messenger bots work from one central ```index.js``` file, and run from one URL (with different paths). The type of questions Susi can currently answer can be found in the [loklak documentation here](https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/blob/development/docs/AskSUSI.md).

## Technology Stack

As of now, all the bots have been developed in ```node.js``` and ```Express``` for smooth builds and CI, so if you wish to add more bots, please add it into our Javascript files. 

## Roadmap and Contributions

We would love to see AskSusi on more platforms. Please help us to develop AskSusi bots for other platforms. 

For contributing, please follow the follow the steps below:

* Please append your code in the ```index.js``` file (without altering the other bots). Add a comment line specifying your platform, like:
```// <platform> BOT FOR SUSI```
and then write your code below it.

* Update the ```package.json``` with your external ```npm``` packages (if you are using them), i.e when you wish to use an external dependancy for your bot, just add the ```save``` flag as well:

	```npm install --save <package>```

* Add the installation / deployment instructions for your bot in the ```installation_docs``` folder, in a ```.md``` file. Keep the filename as ```INSTALLATION_<botplatform>.md```. You should write how to setup such a bot on your platform, and how to make it consume the Susi API. To get a better idea, you can check the instructions of the other docs [here](/installation_docs).

* Add a screenshot of your working bot, along with usage (i.e message format) in the ```README.md```. Also write that the installation instructions of your bot can be found at ```<link to your installation documentation>```.

* Finally, send a **single**, **squashed** PR containing all these changes. Please send your PRs to the ```development``` branch.
